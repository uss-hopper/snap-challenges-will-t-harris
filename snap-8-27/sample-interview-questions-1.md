#1.
* Given an array of numbers
* Write a function that takes one argument, arrayOfNumbers
* Create new object variable inside of function called counterObject
* Loop through arrayOfNumbers, incrementing by 1
* Store current value from arrayOfNumbers in a variable within loop called number
* If counterObject contains a key matching number, add 1 to the value at the number key
* if counterObject does not contain a key matching number, create a key with value of number and set its value to 1 

#2.
* Given two numbers, num1 and num2
* Write a function that takes two arguments, num1 and num2
* Create a loop starting at num1 and ending at num2, incrementing by 1
* Let's call current value of loop currentNumber
* Create variable called functionOutput
* If currentNumber % 2 === 0 AND currentNumber % 3 ==, output += 'baz'
* Else If currentNumber % 2 === 0, output += 'fizz' 
* Else If currentNumber % 3 === 0 , output += 'buzz'
